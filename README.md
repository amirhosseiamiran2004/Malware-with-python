# Malware with python

In this repository, I have written the code of all kinds of Python malware, and I will update every month even with the Windows security system update, I will explain each of these codes below.

## Education

The tutorial on how to make these malwares is on my YouTube channel.

### Ransomware

Ransomware in Python refers to malicious software designed to encrypt a user's files, rendering them inaccessible. Perpetrators then demand a ransom, often in cryptocurrency, for the decryption key. These Python-based attacks exploit vulnerabilities, emphasizing the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and regular software updates.

### Reverce shell

A reverse shell is a type of malicious code written in Python that enables unauthorized access to a victim's system. Once executed, it establishes a connection to a remote attacker, allowing them control over the compromised system. Vigilance against suspicious activities, strong network security, and regularly updated antivirus tools are crucial for preventing such Python-based threats.

### Keylogger

Keyloggers in Python are malicious programs designed to covertly record keystrokes on a user's system. These scripts capture sensitive information, such as login credentials and personal data, posing a serious threat to privacy and security. Protecting against Python-based keyloggers involves employing reputable antivirus software, practicing cautious online behavior, and keeping software up-to-date to address potential vulnerabilities.
